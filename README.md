A simple web application to check how much BUSD you have earned so far while holding RC tokens.

[Retrocade](https://www.retrocadep2e.com/) is [Play-2-Earn](https://playtoearn.net/blockchaingame/retrocade) Arcade Plataform on [Binance Smart Chain](https://www.binance.org/en/smartChain).  
while holding RC tokens, you can play old school games, take part in competitions and earn BUSD passively.

## How it works

The application makes a GraphQL query to [BitQuery](https://bitquery.io) to retrieve the transaction data on BSC related to Retrocade Rewards deployer and the provided eth address.
